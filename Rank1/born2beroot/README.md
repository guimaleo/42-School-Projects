# Born2beRoot

For many students, a strange project. For me the most interesting and intricate project!

The journey was long, the learning curve HUGE.
Was really nice to understand a tiny part of the iceberg called Linux OS.
I'm not yet satisfied with my result, although it's a great mark, but I had limited time to deal with that project, for personal reasons.
I strongly recommend that you try to make your own script, it's really a good knowlegde from Linux OS.
If you think that's a struggle, just go with the guides.

Else...

I really recommend a whole playlist from [Network Chuck](https://networkchuck.com/) called Linux for Hackers
It says it's for Hackers, but you'll surely understand within the first minutes that's for everyone!

I said it was a long journey right?
I'd surely recommend to enroll this free course on Hack The Box Academy! It'll help a lot for this project, you'll get out of the B2BRoot environment and it's really fun to make it!

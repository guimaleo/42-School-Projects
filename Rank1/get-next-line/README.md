# get-next-line 

It seemed easy at the beginning, but after 7 different versions of the same program, I've finally made it!
It was really nice to understand the concepts of buffer, static variable and how it works.
The most difficult part of the project for me was to deal with the memory leaks and understanding how to fix them.
